     * Depth of node - the number of edges from the tree's root node to the node
     * Height of node - the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf
     * Height of Tree - the height of its root node
     *
     * A height-balanced (or self-balancing) binary search tree is a binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small
     * in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. That is, the height of a balanced BST with N nodes is always logN.
     * Also, the height of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.
     *
     * A list of popular height-balanced BSTs for your reference:

     * Red-black tree
     * AVL tree
     * Splay tree
     * Treap
