    /**
     * 宝石与石头
     * 给你一个字符串 jewels 代表石头中宝石的类型，另有一个字符串 stones 代表你拥有的石头。 stones 中每个字符代表了一种你拥有的石头的类型，你想知道你拥有的石头中有多少是宝石。
     * 字母区分大小写，因此 "a" 和 "A" 是不同类型的石头。
     * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
     * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
     *
     * 示例 1：
     * 输入：jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
     * 输出：3
     * 示例 2：
     * 输入：jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
     * 输出：0
