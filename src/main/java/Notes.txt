The depth of a node is from the tree's root to the node.
A root node will have a depth of 1.

The height of a node is the longest path from the node to a leaf.
A leaf node will have a height of 1.

The height of a tree would be the height of its root node,  or equivalently, the depth of its deepest node.

The diameter (or width) of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaf nodes.
